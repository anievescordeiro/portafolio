# Data Science Portafolio

In this place you'll find a list of Data Science personal projects documented in Jupyter Notebooks. Also you'll see things I do with Data I like to play with in order to develop my carrer journey. 

Every project will be identified with a link that redirects to corresponding repo, in order to provide extensive datails and the opportunity to play with code if you are interested.

However, the main insights you'll find here will be ralated to:

- Extraction of insights from raw data and its presentation in a simple way.
- Development of ideas that offer direct value to a customer or some member in a teamwork.
- Expertise in the mathematics involved in the projects and its presentation in an understandable format.

Having said that, I invite you to sneak a peek on this list! 😉

1. **The House Price** problem: in this repo you'll see a step-by-step Jupyter Notebook with a little bit of Data Analysis and the application of two ML regression algorithms (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict the sale price of a house. This Kaggle competition is very fresh to start with some important concepts. Have fun exploring this 🙌🏼  [(click here)](https://github.com/anievescordeiro/house-prices)
