# Data Science Portafolio

In this place you'll find a list of Data Science personal projects documented in Jupyter Notebooks.

Every project will be identified with a link that redirects to corresponding repo, in order to provide extensive details and the opportunity to play with code if you are interested.

However, the main information you'll find here will be ralated to:

- Extraction of insights from raw data and its presentation in a simple way.
- Development of ideas that offer direct value to a customer or some member in a teamwork.
- Expertise in the mathematics involved in the projects and its presentation in an understandable format.

Having said that, here is a list of things that may interest you. Let's take a look on them!

1. **The House Price problem**: in this repo you'll see a step-by-step Jupyter Notebook with a little bit of Data Analysis and the application of two ML regression algorithms (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict the sale price of a house. This Kaggle competition is very fresh to start with some important concepts, have fun exploring this! 🙌🏼  [(click here)](https://github.com/anievescordeiro/house-prices)

2. **The Web Scrapping Books problem**: in this repo you'll see a little tutorial in how to get data from a web page using the `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests` Python libraries. You are going to dive into an code-automatized way of getting the most relevant info in a ficticious web page that sells books. Also, you'll see a data visualization using some `Pandas` code and tools from `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` libraries. Check this book soup and learn something about Web Scrapping 📚🥘   [(click here)](https://github.com/anievescordeiro/book-webscrapping)
3. **Natural Language Processing** task: in this repo you'll see a little interesting NPL task for a job application. Given a dataset of dog names in Zurich, the goal is to find all names that have a **Levenshtein** distance of 1 to the word "Luca". This is a really nice technical question about fuzzy string match in Python to learn how to use the **Levenshtein** package 📐📏  to approximately match strings and determine how similar they are 👌🏼 [(click here)](https://github.com/anievescordeiro/npl_dog_names)
4. **Data Analytics with the NYC Airbnb Open Data**: in this repo you'll find a simple Data Analytics job using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python. Given the New York City Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle we are going to answer some insightful questions that will lead us to explore relevant information about the listings made in this famous city on the Airbnb platform 🏙. This small practice was part of Le Wagon Paris Global Women's Data Day workshop 🚌 [(click here)](https://github.com/anievescordeiro/nyc-airbnb-data-analytics)
